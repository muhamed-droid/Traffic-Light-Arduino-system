# Traffic-Light-Arduino-system
Traffic light simulation using Arduino, to simulate traffic light for pedestrians and drivers. It was my work as a graduate in High school. It  has a lot of theoretical staff, but also practical. It is not highly complicated and practical, but it can be used to make higher level systems that can be more practical.
